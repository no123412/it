 <h1>What were the consequences of Adwa?</h1>
 <ul type="circle"><li>
The Treaty of Addis Ababa, signed in October 1896, officially recognized Ethiopia's sovereignty and marked the only instance of a European power (Italy) formally recognizing an African state's independence during the era of colonialism. 
Adwa's victory helped to preserve Ethiopia's independence and solidified its status as a sovereign nation. 
The battle also served as a warning to other European powers that  the scramble for Africa was not without risk, and that the colonized could and would resist.
