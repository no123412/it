<br>
<li>This Battle of Adwa was a military victory for Ethiopia in 1896, where Ethiopian forces decisively defeated an invading Italian army. </li>
The battle took place near the town of Adwa in northern Ethiopia, in the Tigray region.</li> 
This victory was a significant blow to Italy's efforts to establish a colonial empire in the Horn of Africa. </ul><br />
    
<h2>Why is Adwa important?</h2>
<ul type="circle">
   <li> Adwa is celebrated as a symbol of resistance against colonialism and a testament to the strength and resilience of African nations.
It demonstrates that even the technologically superior European powers could be defeated by determined, unified African forces.
The battle is a source of national pride for Ethiopians and a source of inspiration for others who have faced similar challenges.</li> </ul>
<br>
 
 <h1>What were the consequences of Adwa?</h1>
 <ul type="circle"><li>
The Treaty of Addis Ababa, signed in October 1896, officially recognized Ethiopia's sovereignty and marked the only instance of a European power (Italy) formally recognizing an African state's independence during the era of colonialism. 
Adwa's victory helped to preserve Ethiopia's independence and solidified its status as a sovereign nation. 
The battle also served as a warning to other European powers that  the scramble for Africa was not without risk, and that the colonized could and would resist.
